							Life Meter is the world's first (and best) natural language health and fitness tracking application. We all know that you really can't improve what you don't know. How much do you really eat? How much do you sleep? How effective is your exercise program? But tracking all this stuff can be a real pain. Opening different apps and fumbling though clumsy UI ends up being more trouble than it's worth.
						%p
							Just tell Life Meter the things you want to track. It's as easy as:
						%p
							"I ate 320 calories"
						%p
							"My pulse is 53"
						%p
							"I slept for 7 hours"
						%p
							You can tell Life Meter to start and stop timers for any activity you care about and Life Meter will keep track for you.
						%p
							"Start jogging"
						%p
							"Stop jogging"
						%p
							You can set a target for any activity or measure:
						%p
							"Set a target of 1800 for calories"
						%p
							"Set a target of 7:00 for the 1 mile run"
						%p
							"Set a weight target of 160"
						%p
							Life Meter is designed to be where you are. And it's natural language interface makes tracking the things you care about a breeze. Use Facebook? Just message the Life Meter chat bot. Got Slack? There's a Life Meter bot for that too. Best of all, Life Meter works with Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, so you don't even need a pnone, app, or computer to use it. Just holler across the room:
						%p
							"Alexa, ask Life Meter to check my calories"
						%p
							"Ok Google, tell Life Meter I ate 6 grams of sugar"
