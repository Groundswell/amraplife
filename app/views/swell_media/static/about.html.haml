							AMRAP stands for As Many Reps As Possible. It is a term from high-intensity exersize, massively popularized by CrossFit that challenges you to work as hard as you can in a given time-frame. AMRAP workouts require participants to complete as many movements as they can for however long the workout lasts.

							We feel that's a lot like life: we have a fixed amount of time and we want to live as fully as possible.

							Remarkable Fitness for Regular People
						%p
							Our mission is to promote high-intensity functional exercise, healthy eating, and self-awareness. We want to help you be as fit and healthy as you want to be. We believe that almost anyone can benefit from a higher level of fitness, but most of the programs that actually work are just intimidating. Regular people don't have hours of free time to dedicate to themselves and their health. Regular people don't have hundreds of dollars to spend on gym memberships or personal training or fancy programs.
						%h3
							We're not Fitness as Usual
						%p
							Have you noticed that there are entire cable TV channels dedicated to separating you from your money with promises of 6 week 6 packs? Ridiculous orange people parading around without an ounce of bodyfat... we're not those people. We don't do hype or exageration. 
						%h3
							Life is a Team Sport
						%p
							In the age of Uber and Air-BnB shouldn't it be possible to crowdsource fitness? In the era of Youtube and Twitter, what about democratizing our health? Why in the 21st Century should there be a growing fitness inequality gap?

							We at AMRAP Life strive to help each other live as fully as possible. We seek to inform and inspire each other to be the best that we can be. Join us!
