* Add Fitbit api / sanity-check metric/obs data structure
* wire-up user profile photo update
* convert chart/stat data to units (or ditch for now)
* track events? For now, easy to use start_at and /or end_at for relevant events.... e.g. bed-time, wake-time, workout time,  meal times, etc.
* Add custom units so user can specify water bottle size, etc....
