				CrossFit is an entire subculture onto itself. Walking into a CrossFit gym can be intimidating enough without having to know a TABATA from an EMOM. CrossFit is filled with all kinds of crazy jargon that can be confusing and disorienting to newcomers. More importantly, if you don't have a grasp on some of the cues your coach is providing, you can get yourself injured. Luckily, we've got you covered. Here is the most comprehensive guide to CrossFit-speak ever compiled. We've got over 300 terms (and growing!) defined for you. If you feel we've missed something, or there's a term you still don't understand, please
