			Tracking Basics

			Journal Entries
		%p
			You can use Life Meter as a journal or diary by saying or typing: "Journal...." or "Dear diary....". Journal entries are just free-form text, so they don't contain any values. They don't effect targets, and can't be charted or graphed. We've had some beta-testers simply use Life Meter as a handy audio diary over the Echo, simply recording their thoughts, feeling, and ideas throughout the day.
